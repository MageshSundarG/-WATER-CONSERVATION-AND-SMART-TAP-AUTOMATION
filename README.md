 Water conservation includes to Sustainably manage the Natural Resource of Fresh Water to meet the current and future human demand. 

#Water conservation includes to Sustainably manage the Natural Resource of Fresh Water to meet the current and future human demand. 
#The goals of conservation efforts include:

        1.Ensuring the availability of water for future generation

#The ways by which water can be conserved are -   
 2.Do not leave tap open.
 3.Do not open the tap and run away.
 4.Do not leave tap open while brushing; etc.
#ABSTRACT:
1.Optimizing the use of Water by Time of Flight Sensor and Infra Red Threshold Sensor

2.Digital Image Processing using Open CV in Arduino

3.Fixing a Threshold value for the Minimum Flow of Water

4.Automation of Nozzle based on Obtained Data Binding

5.App creation and Database for better Statistic Values

#OBJECTIVE:
1.Conservation of Domestic and Commercial usage of Water

2.Elimination of Unwanted usage of Water

3.Seamless functioning and a Informational User friendly Environment

4.Obtaining a More Resourceful Statistic Data for the Consumption of Water

5.To meet the current and future human Demand.

#TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1.Time of Flight Sensor

2.InfraRed Thermal Sensor

3.Hall Effect Turbine Flow Sensor

4.JavaScript Framework
